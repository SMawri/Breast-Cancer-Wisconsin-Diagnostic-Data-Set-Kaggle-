# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-Data-Set-Kaggle-
We trying to predict whether the Breast Cancer is benign or malignant.
We have implemented 5 different Classification algorithms to find accuracy in predicting Breast Cancer as Malignant or Benign. The algorithms implemented are as below.
1. Logistic Regression Classifier.
2. K Nearest Neighbor Classifier.
3. Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
4. Decision Tree Classifier.
5. Random Forest Classifier.

Based on the accuracy we found Random Forest Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning gives the best accuracy (98%).
